  <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>^^dkl is an Open Source hardware project that is being developed in
    cooperation between the City of Cologne and <a href="http://www.presseverykey.de">Press Every Key UG</a>.  The
    platform is intended to bridge the gap between devices similar to
    Arduino, which allow physical access to sensors via electronic
    protocols and device like Raspberry Pi that allow comfortable
    programming and access to higher level facilities like Ethernet, USB
    and Bluetooth at the cost of system complexity.</p>

    <p>The system is intended to be used with applications that require
    immediate interaction with the physical world, but need to interact
    with the Internet or user devices. Furthermore, technical expertise
    required to customise and operate the platform should be reduced to a
    minimum.</p>

    <p>Such systems could range from citizen participation platforms such
    as intended by the city of Cologne, smart outdoor multiplayer games
    that players can interact with using their smartphone, but also more
    classical embedded applications such as providing web based access to
    machines in production facilities.</p>

  <h1>Hardware</h1>
    <h2>Specs</h2>
    <h3>Microcontroller</h3>

    <p> The microcontroller is a high end ARM Cortex M3 processor from
    NXP available in several variants depending on specific
    requirements. The microcontroller provides electronic protocols,
    such as i2c, SPI and UARTs, as well as 10-bit ADC and DAC
    capabilities. Furthermore SD communication is supported, and a
    full-size SD card slot is populated on the board. The controller
    allows high speed USB, and the board is fitted with two micro/USB
    sockets, one of which OTG and allows the board to function as a USB
    master device. This allows the device to be used as a peripheral as
    well as controlling USB peripherals connected to the device.</p>

    <h3>Power Management</h3>

    <p> The power management features allow the device to be operated
    either via battery or power supply. Charging facilities for lithium
    batteries are provided on the board. Furthermore the power
    management facilities feature voltage conversion allowing immediate
    interoperation with 5V devices (such as Arduino) with no need for
    additional level shifting circuitry. Finally, the power management
    system is capable of providing electricity to externally connect
    USB-OTG devices and powering external 5V components up to 5W from
    battery. Power to on board components can be individually switched
    for energy efficient operation.</p>

    <h3>Network Connectivity</h3>

    <p> The board features two internet devices: a dedicated 100 MBit
    PHY directly controlled by the microcontroller RJ45 ethernet jack as
    well as packaged WiFi module to allow wireless communication.  </p>

    peripheral roles. This allows device interaction with, e.g.
    smartphone applications as well being able to communicate with
    Bluetooth peripherals with no further components.  </p>

  <h1>Firmware</h1>

  <p> Device firmware is currently being developed. Currently libraries
  to provide basic access to major microcontroller features and on-board
  peripherals exist. We are currently evaluating a real time operating
  systems (either Contiki or FreeRTOS) to port to he board allowing a
  standard programming model on the board. The firmware itself is open
  source and as far as possible, dependencies to proprietary software
  are avoided*. Firmware development is possible and currently being
  realised using a fully open source, command line based development
  toolchain, allowing for a low entry barrier. Proprietary development
  environments are also available to develop the board. The firmware is
  implemented in C.</p>

  <p>You can access the current work in progress state of the firmware
  in the <a href="https://github.com/koelschdeckel/firmware">firmware github repository.</a></p>
